Flask-Nav3 is a fork of [Flask-Nav](https://github.com/mbr/flask-nav) which seems to be unmaintained.

I was using Flask-Nav in several personal projects, when I started seeing deprecation notices, therefore I decided to fork the project and hopefully maintain this fork. Although I don't believe the changes I have made affect backwards compatibility, I am only testing on python 3.7 through 3.11 at this time.

I have also attempted to make the source compatible with [wemake-python-styleguide]](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide).
